# open-o1: Using GPT-4o with CoT to Create o1-like Reasoning Chains

This is an early prototype of using prompting strategies to improve the LLM's reasoning capabilities through o1-like reasoning chains. This allows the LLM to "think" and solve logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models. 
Unlike openai-o1, all the reasoning tokens are shown, and the app uses an open source model.

open-o1 is experimental and being open sourced to help inspire the open source community to develop new strategies to produce o1-like reasoning. 
This experiment helps show the power of prompting reasoning in visualized steps, not a comparison to or full replication of o1, which uses different techniques. 
OpenAI's o1 is instead trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using Chain of Thought, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex PhD-level problems. 

open-o1 demonstrates the potential of prompting alone to overcome straightforward LLM logic issues like the Strawberry problem, allowing existing open source models to benefit from dynamic reasoning chains and an improved interface for exploring them.

### How it works

open-o1 powered by gpt-4o creates reasoning chains, in principle a dynamic Chain of Thought, that allows the LLM to "think" and solve some logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models.

At each step, the LLM decides whether to continue or provide a final answer, with titles for clarity. The prompt includes tips such as exploring alternative answers and employing multiple methods to derive the solution.

This approach, combining Chain of Thought reasoning with the exploration of alternatives and self-awareness of limitations, significantly improves accuracy on problems like the Strawberry problem, achieving about 70% accuracy without additional training (compared to 30% without prompts).

### Examples

> [!IMPORTANT]
> open-o1 is not perfect, but it can perform significantly better than LLMs out-of-the-box. From initial testing, open-o1 accurately solves simple logic problems 60-80% of the time that usually stump LLMs.


##### How many Rs are in strawberry?
Prompt: How many Rs are in strawberry?

Result:

![Strawberry example](https://github.com/shibing624/open-o1/blob/main/docs/r3.png)
---

Prompt: Which is larger, .9 or .11?

Result:

### Quickstart

To use the Streamlit UI, follow these instructions:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk...
streamlit run app.py
```

### Prompting Strategy

The prompt is as follows:

```
You are an expert AI assistant that explains your reasoning step by step. For each step, provide a title that describes what you're doing in that step, along with the content. 
Decide if you need another step or if you're ready to give the final answer. Respond in JSON format with 'title', 'content', and 'next_action' (either 'continue' or 'final_answer') keys. USE AS MANY REASONING STEPS AS POSSIBLE. 
AT LEAST 3. BE AWARE OF YOUR LIMITATIONS AS AN LLM AND WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO. IN YOUR REASONING, INCLUDE EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE ANSWERS. CONSIDER YOU MAY BE WRONG, AND IF YOU ARE WRONG IN YOUR REASONING, WHERE IT WOULD BE. 
FULLY TEST ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES. YOU CAN BE WRONG. WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING, ACTUALLY RE-EXAMINE, AND USE ANOTHER APPROACH TO DO SO. DO NOT JUST SAY YOU ARE RE-EXAMINING. USE AT LEAST 3 METHODS TO DERIVE THE ANSWER. USE BEST PRACTICES.

Example of a valid JSON response:
{
    "title": "Identifying Key Information",
    "content": "To begin solving this problem, we need to carefully examine the given information and identify the crucial elements that will guide our solution process. This involves...",
    "next_action": "continue"
}
```

#### Breakdown
1. **Persona**: The assistant role is set as an expert AI.
2. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Each step must be titled and detailed, with prompts for possible continuation or finalization.
3. **JSON Formatting**: Responses are structured in JSON format for clarity.
4. **Best Practices**: Emphasized in all-caps for importance, including:
    - Using multiple reasoning steps.
    - Being aware of limitations.
    - Exploring alternative answers.
    - Re-examining and using another approach.
    - Using at least 3 methods to derive the answer.
    - Using best practices.
